# upfast-tf

Web platform that hosts and monitors free public dedicated video game (Team Fortress 2) servers.  https://upfast.tf   
 

This a personal project of mine. I created it mainly to gain experience provisioning and managing cloud servers.

Servers are hosted on AWS EC2 instances created with Terraform. I monitor the server health with Prometheus. The backend is written in Go and uses sqlite.

Future plans:  
 - Add more public servers

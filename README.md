# tf2dl-servers

A web platform that hosts and monitors public, dedicated Team Fortress 2 servers on AWS. https://servers.tf2dl.net (previously upfast.tf)

This is a personal project built to learn more about cloud infrastructure and server management. Servers run on EC2 Linux instances, provisioned with Terraform and configured via Bash scripts. Server monitoring is handled through Prometheus and Grafana, with a Go backend using SQLite.
